# Nibog Event Booking Platform - Technical Analysis Report

## 1. API Implementation

### 1.1 Authentication APIs
- **Login API** (`/api/auth/login.ts`): Handles user authentication
- **Register API** (`/api/auth/register.ts`): Handles user registration
- **Admin Authentication** (`/api/admin/login.ts`, `/api/admin/check-auth.ts`): Specialized authentication for admin users

### 1.2 Event Management APIs
- **Events API** (`/api/events/index.ts`): 
  - GET: Retrieves events with filtering by city, date, and status
  - POST: Creates new events (admin only)
- **Admin Events API** (`/api/admin/events.ts`, `/api/admin/events/[id].ts`):
  - GET: Retrieves all events for admin dashboard
  - POST: Creates new events
  - PUT: Updates existing events
  - DELETE: Removes events (via [id] endpoint)

### 1.3 Registration APIs
- **Registrations API** (`/api/registrations/index.ts`):
  - GET: Retrieves user registrations
  - POST: Creates new registrations with validation for event capacity and eligibility

### 1.4 City and Game APIs
- **Cities API** (`/api/cities/index.ts`): Retrieves city information
- **Games API** (`/api/games/index.ts`): Retrieves game information
- **Admin Cities API** (`/api/admin/cities.ts`, `/api/admin/cities/[id].ts`): CRUD operations for cities
- **Admin Games API** (`/api/admin/games.ts`, `/api/admin/games/[id].ts`): CRUD operations for games

### 1.5 Payment APIs
- **Payments API** (`/api/payments/index.ts`): Handles payment processing
- **Payment Webhook** (`/api/payment/webhook.ts`): Processes payment callbacks

### 1.6 Admin Dashboard API
- **Dashboard Stats API** (`/api/admin/dashboard-stats.ts`): Provides statistics for the admin dashboard

## 2. Pending Tasks

### 2.1 Frontend Implementation
- **Real Event Data Integration**: The homepage currently uses mock data (`MOCK_EVENTS`) instead of fetching real events from the API
- **Payment Processing Flow**: The payment processing flow is incomplete, with placeholder components in the UI
- **Admin Dashboard Charts**: The admin dashboard has placeholder charts that need to be implemented with real data visualization

### 2.2 API Enhancements
- **Event Search API**: The search functionality on the homepage needs to be connected to the backend API
- **User Profile API**: Missing API for user profile management
- **Registration Cancellation**: No API endpoint for canceling registrations

### 2.3 Features
- **Email Notifications**: Email sending is implemented but needs proper configuration and templates
- **QR Code Generation**: QR code functionality is imported but not fully implemented
- **Payment Gateway Integration**: Payment processing is partially implemented but needs complete integration

## 3. Verification and Validation

### 3.1 API Functionality
- **Events API**: Properly implemented with filtering, pagination, and error handling
- **Registrations API**: Correctly validates event capacity and user authentication
- **Admin APIs**: Properly secured with authentication middleware

### 3.2 Frontend-Backend Integration
- **Event Details Page**: Correctly fetches and displays event information
- **Registration Form**: Properly validates child age against game requirements
- **Admin Dashboard**: Displays mock data but is structured correctly for real data integration

### 3.3 Authentication Flow
- **User Authentication**: Implemented using Clerk with proper session management
- **Admin Authentication**: Custom implementation with secure token handling

## 4. Database and API Integration

### 4.1 Database Schema
- **User Model**: Properly defined with authentication fields
- **Event Model**: Well-structured with relationships to City and Game models
- **Registration Model**: Correctly links users to events
- **Payment Model**: Structured for payment tracking but not fully utilized

### 4.2 API-Database Interaction
- **Prisma ORM**: Correctly used for database operations
- **Data Validation**: Input validation implemented before database operations
- **Relationship Handling**: Proper inclusion of related data in API responses

## 5. Issue Identification and Resolution

### 5.1 Critical Issues
- **Mock Data Usage**: Homepage and admin dashboard use mock data instead of real API data
- **Incomplete Payment Flow**: Payment processing is not fully implemented
- **Missing Email Configuration**: Email sending functionality lacks proper configuration

### 5.2 Performance Concerns
- **API Error Handling**: Some API endpoints have generic error messages
- **Database Query Optimization**: Some queries could be optimized for better performance

### 5.3 Security Considerations
- **Input Validation**: Additional validation needed for user inputs
- **API Rate Limiting**: No rate limiting implemented for API endpoints
- **Error Exposure**: Some endpoints expose detailed error information

## 6. Recommendations

### 6.1 Immediate Fixes
1. **Replace Mock Data**: Implement real API data fetching on the homepage
2. **Complete Payment Integration**: Finalize the payment processing flow
3. **Configure Email Notifications**: Set up proper email templates and configuration

### 6.2 Short-term Improvements
1. **Implement Missing APIs**: Add user profile and registration cancellation APIs
2. **Enhance Admin Dashboard**: Implement real data visualization
3. **Improve Error Handling**: Standardize error responses across all APIs

### 6.3 Long-term Enhancements
1. **API Documentation**: Create comprehensive API documentation
2. **Performance Optimization**: Optimize database queries and API responses
3. **Security Hardening**: Implement rate limiting and additional security measures

## 7. Conclusion

The Nibog Event Booking Platform has a solid foundation with well-structured APIs and database schema. The core functionality for event browsing, registration, and administration is implemented, but several features remain incomplete. By addressing the identified issues and implementing the recommended improvements, the platform can be brought to a production-ready state.

Key priorities should be replacing mock data with real API integration, completing the payment processing flow, and enhancing the admin dashboard with real data visualization. These improvements will significantly enhance the user experience and administrative capabilities of the platform.
